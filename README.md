# EVAC – Emergency Response System Design Project
## Project Overview
EVAC is a system-level engineering project focused on designing a compact, reliable, and self-sufficient emergency response solution...
The project addresses a critical problem observed during natural disasters and industrial accidents: the inability to quickly gather essential survival equipment under stress and panic.

Problem Definition

In emergency situations, time pressure and panic significantly reduce people’s ability to make rational decisions. EVAC aims to ensure a rapid and effective response by providing a pre-configured, all-in-one evacuation system that supports safety, autonomy, and operational reliability.

System Concept

The EVAC system is designed as a modular emergency kit integrating:

Protection and shelter components

Energy and food autonomy

Communication and localization (GPS, solar charging)

First aid, hygiene, and essential documentation storage

The focus was placed on system interaction, workflow clarity, and feasibility, rather than individual components alone.

My Role

Designed the system architecture and workflow of the EVAC solution

Analyzed feasibility, reliability, and user interaction under emergency conditions

Contributed to process-oriented thinking linking user needs, system components, and operational constraints

Worked within an international team, coordinating technical and functional aspects

Engineering Focus

System-level thinking

Workflow and process design

Reliability under stress conditions

Integration of technology into practical engineering solutions

Context

This project was developed at Polytech Nancy – Université de Lorraine within an entrepreneurship and engineering framework, combining technical reasoning with real-world constraints and market awareness.
